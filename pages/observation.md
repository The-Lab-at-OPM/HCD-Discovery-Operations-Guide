## Setting up for a good observation

Observations present an opportunity for first-hand understanding of your participants’ experience. Observations, like interviews, have many styles, but a good place to start is to choose one of two broad approaches: fly-on-the-wall or participatory observation.

Fly-on-the-wall observations mean that the researcher stays silent while the participant accomplishes the task(s) that are pertinent to your project. Take notes and, if possible, pictures, while they accomplish their work so that you can understand the ins and outs of the system(s) in which they interact.

Participatory obeservation means getting a hands-on experience of the system through playing a role in the system(s). This can mean anything from playing a role in the interaction with your participant to actually learning all or part of the system from the participant so that you can experience it yourself.

In both of these methods, the data you collect will be multi-sensorial. It’s important to note what you see and hear, of course, but also pay attention to what you might touch or how you might have to move, what smells or distractions there might be. When writing your notes, strive to use expressive language so that you can remember these different sensorial aspects of the observation.

## Checklist

Use this checklist to prepare the night before you go into observation-based research.

- Review the HCD Discovery Concept Guide's section on <a href= "https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/HCD-Design-Concept-Guide/during/">Research.</a>
- Check with the participant the day before to see if specialized gear is needed.
- Review the participant’s background and how what information you might have on how they work.
- Gather your supplies and pack them: camera, recorder, notebook.
- Have an idea of which method you might prefer for this observation: fly-on-the-wall or participatory.
- Print out and have digital versions of your interview/ conversation guide.
- Review your project elevator pitch.
- Focus. Get yourself mentally ready to deeply listen and interact with another person.
