## Setting up for a good interview

As was said in the previous section, think of interviews more as guided conversation than formal interviews with listed questions you have to follow. Your research guide should contain keywords or phrases that outline topics you need to cover. This format allows you to work the topics into the conversation fluidly, so that the engagement takes a natural tone.

The night before the interview, check your supplies. A tablet is fine to take notes, but no keyboards; the sounds of keystrokes is distracting to both the interviewer and the interviewee. In terms of dress, always attempt to look business casual.

Arrive at the interview site early so as to gather as a team before entering the interview. Ensure that everyone knows their roles at that time. Review your problem frame statement and elevator pitch; this ensures that the team  is focused and each interview starts from the same informational basis.

Post-interview, gather the on-site team to discuss and jot down interesting points from the interview. Use this time to build on what you learned and develop new things to ask about in the following interviews. After you’re done huddling, send your interviewee a quick email thanking them for their time.

## Checklist

Use this checklist to prepare the night before you hit the road to do research in the field.

- Review the HCD Discovery Concept Guide's section on <a href= "https://the-lab-at-opm.github.io/HCD-Design-Concept-Guide/during/">Research.</a>
- Check with the Logistics Coordinator on interview site details before the day of the interview.
- Review the interviewee’s background the night before the interview via social media, publication, and your Recruiter or Local Contact’s notes.
- Gather your personal supply of notebooks, pens, and sticky notes.
- Have print and digital versions of your interview/ conversation guide.
- Review your project elevator pitch. This is the one or two minute project description you developed to use during the Recruiting phase.
- Focus. Get yourself mentally ready to deeply listen and interact with another person.
